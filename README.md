# Building a Neuron from Scratch

# Purpose:
The project aims to create a simple artificial neuron that can decide whether someone likes or dislikes a snack based on its saltiness and spiciness levels. It's like teaching a computer to think a bit like a person when it comes to food preferences.

# How It Works:

**Gathering Data:** We start by collecting data about people's snack preferences, noting down whether they like or dislike each snack along with its saltiness and spiciness levels.

Processing Data: We analyze this data, separating snacks into liked and disliked categories and calculating the average saltiness and spiciness for each group.

Finding Patterns: Using some math magic, we figure out the relationship between saltiness and spiciness for liked snacks. This helps us determine how much someone tends to prefer salty or spicy snacks.

Creating the Neuron: Now, armed with this understanding, we build a simplified model of a neuron, which is like a tiny decision-making unit. We give it the ability to take in inputs (saltiness and spiciness levels of a snack), multiply them by certain weights (which represent how important each input is), and add a bias (a sort of baseline preference).

Activation: The neuron then crunches these numbers together and decides whether the snack is liked or disliked based on a simple rule. If the result is positive, it says the snack is liked; otherwise, it says it's disliked.

Testing: Finally, we put our neuron to the test by giving it the saltiness and spiciness levels of two snacks. It evaluates them and gives us its verdict: like or dislike.
